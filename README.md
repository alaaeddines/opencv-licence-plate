# Moroccan License Plate Extraction with OpenCV

This project explores computer vision techniques for extracting license plates from images, focusing on Moroccan license plates. It utilizes OpenCV, a popular library for real-time computer vision.
Recognizing license plates in real-world scenarios can be a complex task due to factors like lighting variations, occlusions, and different plate formats. This project might not achieve perfect accuracy in all cases.

## Project Goal:

Develop an algorithm to detect and extract Moroccan license plates from images.

## Libraries:

* OpenCV (Computer Vision)
* google.colab.patches.cv2_imshow (for displaying images in Google Colab)
* Matplotlib (for plotting visualizations)
